Playlist
========

A HTML / CSS / JS app to explore the playlists I've been creating everymonth since 2003

Currently a work inprogress

Todo:

- when grabbing data for lookup force keys to lower case
- when getting data from lookup force input to lowercase
- write a script to add old playlists to spotify
- get year of track from spotify for those that don't have it
- attempt to get artist, album, track id's for items that don't have it
- will need to install q to or proper promise looping
- once json data is good, remove xml data
- once lookup is rebuilt, do not overwrite, only update on get data
- sanitise playlists, some have playlists as the album title, some will not be found on spotify
